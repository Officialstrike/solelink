## TODO
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

Here's a couple things I would like to do:

- [ ] Fix CSP, stop using `unsafe-inline` and use hash's instead; [Proposed solution](vite-utils.js#L47), [Helpful resource](https://content-security-policy.com/hash/)
- [ ] Prefetch the CSS; pending https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/11484https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/11484
- [ ] Switch to using tailwind defined colors(IE define colors in tailwind.config.cjs)
- [ ] Allow user to change tailwind defined colors
- [ ] Stop using data uri's(base64 images) and just import them
- [ ] allow for qrcodes to be replaced with custom image
- [ ] create a plugin to download image urls to the disk
- [ ] create a web interface for a more simplified interface, this can come in many forms such as:
    - A config generator, which might have possibility to be interoperable with cf pages
    - A web interface with a backend attached to it to generate assets for the user
    - Take inspiration from Stackblitz's webcontainers and somehow run the vite build process in the browser
- [ ] allow for background to be customized with images
- [ ] try to reduce the JS to the be the least possible
- [ ] Allow for custom themes
- [ ] A redesign working with professional designers
